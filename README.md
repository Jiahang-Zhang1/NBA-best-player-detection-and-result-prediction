I. Topic Overview: Machine learning is a general term for a class of algorithms used to extract hidden patterns from large amounts of historical data for prediction or classification. More specifically, machine learning can be viewed as finding a function where the input is sample data and the output is the desired result, although this function is too complex to be easily formally expressed. The goal of machine learning is to ensure that the model trained on the training samples can be well applied to "new samples," that is, the trained model can help us predict or solve future events, demonstrating good generalization ability. Machine learning can be broadly divided into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the input data is called "training data," and each set of training data has a clear label or result. When building a prediction model, supervised learning establishes a learning process, comparing the prediction results with the actual results of the "training data," and continuously adjusting the prediction model until the model's prediction results reach a desired accuracy. Common applications of supervised learning include classification and regression problems. The methods I learned this semester, such as logistic regression, perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors, are mostly supervised learning algorithms. In unsupervised learning, the data is not specifically labeled; the learning model aims to infer some inherent structure of the data. Common applications include learning association rules and clustering, such as the K-Means algorithm I learned this semester. There are many machine learning methods; finding a suitable model for prediction and testing to solve practical problems is our ultimate goal in learning machine learning. The NBA, or National Basketball Association, is a men's professional basketball league composed of 30 professional teams in North America. It is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and was founded in New York in 1946. Its rapid development and growing influence in the global basketball arena attract outstanding players from all over the country, representing world-class basketball and representing the dream of every basketball player. The NBA season is divided into preseason, regular season, All-Star Game, and playoffs. The preseason serves as a warm-up for the season, while the regular season showcases individual player skill and team strength, a crucial period for many players to establish their value. Regular season performance largely determines a player's form and ability. Teams are ranked by points, with the top-ranked teams advancing to the playoffs to compete for the season championship. The All-Star Game is an entertainment event where judges and fans vote to select players from various backgrounds to form temporary teams for an exhibition game. Most players selected for the All-Star Game are outstanding performers. The playoffs are primarily a knockout tournament, allowing for deeper team analysis and providing a more exciting viewing experience. Players who excel in the playoffs prove their worth and establish their value. As a basketball enthusiast, I've played with friends since middle school, enjoying watching games and witnessing the rise of the Golden State Warriors dynasty, cheering for every great play they made. Now that I've learned machine learning, I can use data analysis and training to select top players and predict team wins and losses, which is quite interesting. Machine learning also has significant practical value in NBA data prediction and analysis. Through machine learning, we can more objectively evaluate a player's performance, assist coaches in developing game tactics, and make player substitutions. For team owners, data analysis can provide valuable advice on player selection and substitutions during the transfer window. Therefore, utilizing machine learning methods for NBA data analysis has extremely strong practical significance.

This project will address two problems: first, detecting outliers and selecting high-performing players using existing data; and second, predicting games by analyzing and training team game information.
